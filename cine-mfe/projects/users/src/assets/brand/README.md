Place the official Banco Guayaquil brand assets in this folder:\r\n\r\n1. banco-guayaquil-logo.webp (preferred) or banco-guayaquil-logo.png – logo used in the global header.\r\n2. banco-guayaquil.jpg (or .webp) – hero background for dashboards.\r\n\r\nThe code already references these paths under /assets/brand/. Add the authorized images locally so they render in every environment.\r\n
